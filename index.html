  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  This workshop is hosted by the <a href="http://www.ub.unibas.ch/ub-hauptbibliothek/">University Library</a> Basel.
  It is organized in collaboration with the <a href="http://sib.swiss/">SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics</a>
  and with support from SIB and the <a href="http://www.swissbib.ch/">Swissbib</a> project.
 </p>
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This could be applied to <a href="http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/">libarians</a> as well.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.

        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your

  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>

      <h4 id="git-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>

        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for

    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all <a
      href='http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility'>supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).

  <h3>OpenRefine</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data: 
	cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data.
	
	Please look at the <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions">Installation Instructions</a>
	from the OpenRefine project for more details on how to run OpenRefine on your machine. The instructions below are adapted from this link.
	We will be using <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/tag/2.6-rc.2">version 2.6-rc2</a> during the
	workshop.
	
	A <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</a> is required to run OpenRefine. If the installation procedure below fails, make sure you have
	a working JRE installed on your computer.

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
